    <p>Everything in Scorpio<sup>4</sup> is described by a URI. So, let's take a look at them in more detail.

    There are three distinct types of URI, each with their own use cases: </p>

    <h2>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
    <p>URLs are, by definition, internet protocols. They locate and retrieve data within the Internet's address space. The "cloud" extends to your intranet, and your home wifi too.</p>
    <p>We all know that the <code>http:</code> is immensely powerful. It's the world wide web. But that's only a tiny part of the Internet address space.  </p>

    <p>There are many others, such as <code>smb:</code>, <code>imap:</code>, <code>ssh:</code> and <code>ftp:</code>.
    There are hundreds of protocols, each potentially as powerful. What would you do if you could completely
    control everything on your personal Internet?</p>
    <p>There are protocols for databases, file servers, instant messaging, network monitoring and telephony. The Scorpio<sup>4</sup> project is committed to making them all accessible.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<code>4</code> supports physical protocols, like <code>http:</code> &amp; <code>file:</code> as well as pseudo-protocols like <code>sql:</code> or even <code>salesforce:</code>. In most cases, you need not be concerned about the mechanism employed to resolve the protocols.</p>
    <p>Just as with <code>http:</code>, the other protocols often employ <code>?named=values</code> to represent stateful parameters.</p>

    <h2>URN (Uniform Resource Notation)</h2>
    <p>A <b>URN</b> is useful but not as capable as the more familiar <b>URL</b>. It is a local identifier
        that points to a resource within a self contained system. You may know them variously as GUIDs or UUIDs.</p>
    <p>They all begin with the <code>urn:</code> prefix. Scorpio<sup>4</sup> reserves these for your internal concepts and entities. They should be employed with reservation.</p>

    <p> It's common practice to use MD5 or SHA1 keys, for example: <code>urn:uuid:43A368A6-4FEEF833-9CCF389A-5CE9F1B4-C5D5637A</code></p>
    <h2>Blank Nodes (Anonymous Resources)</h2>
    <p><b>Blank Nodes</b> are used inside collections, such as a lists and sets to identify the members. In our examples, they are automatically generated by the N3 notation.</p>
    <p>While often mis-understood, and a little tricky to grasp, they prove useful in practice.</p>
    <p>Blank Nodes are often hidden, but they look like <code>:_b123123</code>. The leading <code>:</code> identifies they are local within some external context. It unsafe to refer to them outside of their specific context.</p>
    <p>We will return to Blank Nodes shortly.</p>
