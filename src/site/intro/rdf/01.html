    <h2>Statements of Fact</h2>

    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> uses RDF to describe it's view of the world.
    RDF allows us to make statements about the world, by combining three URIs into a statement, called a triple.</p>
    <p>Triples can be expressed in numerous notations. The Scorpio<sup>4</sup> team prefer the rather human-readable <code>N3</code> notation but cousins, such as <code>XML</code> and <code>JSON</code> exist.</p>

    <p>The general format of an RDF statement looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;statement&gt;   &lt;property&gt;   &lt;object&gt;. </pre>

    <p>Where each of the &lt;&gt; terms are understood to be URIs. The benefit of using URIs is that they have a globally significant meaning.</p>
    <p>Each URI is administered within a namespace. For example, we use a <code>http://scorpio4demo.com/</code> for our examples.</p>
    <p>Domain names are ideal for this purpose, and RDF was designed to work perfectly with the original world wide web.</p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>The &lt;property&gt; are the most expressive of the three. They define the relationships between the subject and object terms.
    They can thought of as adjectives, verbs, predicates or simply links depending on the context.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> uses the properties to bring your statements to life, when those properties are defined by an Active Vocabulary.</p>

    <h2>Hard Facts</h2>
    <p>URIs can get unwieldy, and our triples require three (3) of them. Helpfully, RDF includes a mechanism to shorten them, we can use a <code>PREFIX</code>:</p>
    <pre>
        @PREFIX     eg:        &lt;http://scorpio4demo.com/example/#&gt;.
        @PREFIX     rdf:       &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;.
        @PREFIX     :          &lt;http://scorpio4demo.com/example/eg01#&gt;.

        # Our first fact in N3 notation:
        :fact1      rdf:type    eg:Example.</pre>

    <p>In this example, we have declared and used three namespaces: <code>rdf:</code>, <code>eg:</code> and a solitary <code>:</code> notation meaning the current document.</p>
    <p>We have stated that <code>:something</code> within the local document is an instance of the class of <code>eg:Example</code> entities. Or colloquially, <code>something</code> is an <code>Example</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>rdf:</code> namespace is defined by the W3C, and forms the core of the RDF standard. The RDF vocabulary (by convention) defines all of it's terms within that namespace.</p>
    <p>You will create many namespaces of your own, they are often documents that are stored on the WWW (hence, the <code>HTTP</code>).</p>

    <h2>Literal Facts</h2>
    <p>A second variation of statements are permitted, these describe literal values.
        For a literal, the object is replaced with a simple string notation.</p>

    <pre>
        &lt;statement&gt;   &lt;property&gt;   &quot;object&quot;^^&lt;data-type&gt;.</pre>

    <p>The literals are very useful for describing human-readable meta-data. They are usefully less well defined than
    the URI object. It is still a triple, the 3rd URI is used to denote the data-type rather than the data iteelf.</p>
    <p>The <code>^^&lt;data-type&gt;</code> can be omitted, in which case an <code>xsd:string</code> is assumed. This makes the common case rather concise.</p>

    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> mostly works using the first variant, what we call "hard facts" as opposed to "literal facts".</p>
