    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>We take a meta-data driven approach to application development. At the heart of Scorpio<sup>4</sup> is an RDF/RDFS data model backed by a dynamic execution environment. </p>
    <p>Everything in Scorpio<sup>4</sup> is meta-data. We think about your data simply as meta-data about reality, which seems to fits  with the RDF/Linked Data/Semantic Web view of the world.</p>

    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> encourages and empowers you to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>use URIs to identify everything of importance</li>
        <li>use URIs as tags to express relationships.</li>
        <li>use RDF to formally describe your application domain</li>
        <li>use RDFS to give your data a richer "semantic" meaning</li>
        <li>use SPARQL rules to generate data models, user interfaces, enforce constraints and apply validation</li>
        <li>use SPARQL rules to check for inconsistencies, logic errors and contradictions</li>
        <li>use <a href="assets.html">asset templates</a> to generate HTML, CSV, XML, SQL, SPARQL, source code or even RDF.</li>
        <li>use <a href="active.html">Active Vocabularies</a> to describe APIs, build user interfaces, integrations, work flows and business rules.</li>
    </ol>
