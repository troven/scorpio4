    <h2>Goals &amp; Motivation</h2>

    <p>Our work is based upon the principle that if we have smart data then we can have simpler code. Simpler code means software development is less risky, more agile and remains aligned to the business over time.</p>

    <p>With Scorpio<sup>4</sup> developers and subject matter experts can collaborate using a shared semantic understanding about the problem domain, and the application they are developing to support it.</p>

    <p>We like to think that Scorpio<sup>4</sup> helps you to turn data into knowledge, and then turn that knowledge into action.</p>
    <p>We fancy the term <i>Wisdom Management</i> to describe the construction and maintenance of an <a href="esot.html">executable source of truth</a>.</p>

    <h4>Actionable Knowledge</h4>
    <p>In many complex businesses, such as health care, technology and financial services, if we don't drive our businesses off of actionable data then we're not going to be here much longer.</p>
    <p>Your data lives in multiple places, in a plethora of formats and technologies. Scorpio<sup>4</sup> encompasses a rich suite of tools to extract, integrate, export, combine, transform, translate, visualise, execute and explore them.</p>

    <h4>RDF / Graph Data Model</h4>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> uses a RDF-based semantic model to describe your problem domain and how to interact with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>An RDF-based graph is expressive enough to provide near-native expressiveness for developers, supports powerful abstractions and domain languages that subject matter experts can also read.</p>

    <h4>Universal Glue</h4>
    <p>By using RDF as a modelling language, Scorpio makes is easier than ever to build robust online or offline agile, adaptive applications that integrate and collaborate with people and systems, intelligently.</p>
    <p>It is equally well suited for model-driven development, master data management, content management, enterprise integration and cloud orchestration.</p>

    <h4>Links, Tags and Relationships</h4>
    <p>Every part of our world is related in some way. Those relationships connect information together, they create knowledge from data .</p>
    <p>In RDF, a predicate is the base type for all kinds of links, tags and relationships. Since each are URIs, they should also link to definitions about themselves.</p>
    <p>Predicates can trigger the <a href="rdfs.html">inference</a> of more meta-data or <a href="active.html">invoke some behaviour</a>.</p>

    <h4>Intuitive Inferencing</h4>
    <p>Whilst RDFS supports logical inferencing, Scorpio<sup>4</sup> supports Intuitive Inferencing to encode what subject matter experts can infer from their domain data and meta-data.</p>
    <p>Take for example: a simple database, 3 tables - customers, orders and products. For each table, we need a data entry screen. For each field in the data schema, we need a field onscreen. When the schema states we have relationships, they imply validation rules.</p>
    <p>With a few simple rules, you can scan your SQL database, capture it's schema. From a well-designed SQL schema, it's trivial to infer data models, business objects, queries. Even most of the UI that makes up a simple database application.</p>
    <p>Since everything is logically derived from the source, when the SQL schema changes, the application regenerates.</p>
    <p>To change your application, simply tweak the inferencing rules that are written in <a href="sparql.html">SPARQL</a>.</p>

    <h4>Explicit Intentions</h4>
    <p>Where frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, CakePHP and Grails generate code, Scorpio<sup>4</sup> generates and executes meta-data.
    <p>Unlike with XML, JSON, YAML or fluent APIs that are commonly used to implement declarative development,
    Scorpio<sup>4</sup> uses a self-describing semantic data model that can be queried, transformed, verified and published making it easier to handle complex requirements, scalability and maintenance.</p>

    <h4>As-Built Documentation</h4>
    <p>If your application is described using RDF, then the as-built documentation that can be derived is always up to date. </p>
    <p>Every part of your software solution is linked. Your meta-data describes your data. Your user interface is derived from the same.
        Your validation rules are link. Your business processes consume and produce data according to your source of truth model.</p>

    <h4>Intelligent Integration</h4>
    <p>In today's hyper-connected world, applications must have integration as a 1st-class capability.
        With Scorpio<sup>4</sup> we take your meta-data about your integrations and execute them.</p>
