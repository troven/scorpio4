    <h2>SPARQL Rules</h2>
    <p>SPARQL is the query language for the semantic web.</p>
    <p>SPARQL Rules use the CONSTRUCT query form to infer a new set of facts from an existing set. This is a subtle, powerful technique that Scorpio<sup>4</sup> seeks to fully explore, facilitate and exploit.</p>
    <p>For example:
    <pre>
    Take a schema of SQL tables. Each table has columns that represent our data, along with some information about their data type .
    We want to generate a data entry Form to capture and validate each field.
    We create a SPARQL query that takes each column in the table and generates a corresponding Form Field.
    Default validation is applied based on the SQL data type.
    Each UI field is related to it's data field, and that relationship is explicitly stated.
    In this way, a single query can transform a SQL schema (Model) into a View definition.
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Doing so, means that the UI is always in lock-step with the data model, and their relationships can be interrogated (by SPARQL) at design-time or at runtime.</p>

    Some Use Cases
    <ul>
        <li>copy existing facts from one repository to another</li>
        <li>derive new facts from existing facts</li>
        <li>convert data from one vocabulary to another</li>
        <li>identify data that does not conform</li>
    </ul>
