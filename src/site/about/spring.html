    <h2>Active Beans</h2>
    <p>Active Beans is an Active Vocabulary to manage the lifecycle of Java objects</p>
    <p>The ubiquitous Spring IoC framework can be used to manage the lifecycle and configuration of Scorpio<sup>4</sup> application components</p>
    <p>Spring can be used to contextually configure data access objects, user interfaces as well as to integrate other components and libraries into the Scorpio<sup>4</sup> runtime environment.</p>
    <p>At runtime, the Java object graph is constructed by interpreting semantic data models. These models can be inferred and derived from existing domain knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Bean Ontology</h3>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> implements the Bean Ontology to configure and register bean definitions. At runtime, these
    definitions are resolved to construct the appropriate runtime Java environment as required.</p>
    <p>The current integration is substantially functional, complex cases and more esoteric features are not yet supported.</p>
