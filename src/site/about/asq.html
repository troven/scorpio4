    <h2>Active ASQ</h2>

    <p>ASQ is Scorpio<sup>4</sup>'s Abstract Semantic Query language. It's a way to talk about
    triple patterns.</p>
    <p>We'll create a semantic query of the following SPARQL: </p>
    <pre>
        SELECT ?this WHERE {
            ?this a eg:Example.
        }</pre>
    <p>Only triples that match the pattern are returned, in this case all <code>eg:Example</code>s.  </p>

    <p>Technically, we want to solve <code>?this</code> for anything that is a <code>rdf:type</code> of <code>eg:Example</code>.</p>
    <p>ASQ provides 3 predicates to talk about each part of the triple pattern:</p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing='0' cellpadding="5">
        <tr><td><code>asq:this</code></td><td><code>asq:has</code></td><td><code>asq:that</code></td></tr>
        <tr><td>:this</td><td>rdf:type</td><td>eg:Example</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>ASQ adopts the convention that local names, such as <code>:this</code> are used to refer to a solution variable. In this case, <code>?this</code> in SPARQL is the same as <code>:this</code> in ASQ</p>
    <p>Lets begin with some boilerplate. It's semantic politeness.</p>
    <pre>
    @prefix : 		        &lt;http://example.com/asq/Example/&gt;.

    :		    a	        eg:Example.
    :		    a	        asq:Query.</pre>

    <p>The <code>asq:where</code> predicate is used to specify a triple pattern.
    <pre><strike>
	:           asq:where       :pattern1.
	:pattern1   asq:this        :this.    </strike></pre>

    <pre>
	:	asq:this	:this;
		asq:has		rdf:type;
		asq:that	eg:Example;
    .
    </pre>
    <p>It's time step up our syntax. The <code>;</code> replaces the <code>.</code> to indicate that a common subject is shared between triples.</p>

    <p>We can also use <code>[]</code> to talk about "something". This lets us join our
        3 pattern terms to the query, using <code>asq:where</code></p>
    <pre>
	: asq:where [
		asq:this	:this;
		asq:has		rdf:type;
		asq:that	eg:Example;
	];</pre>

    <p>Technically, the [] is a blank node. This anonymous URI is used as the object of the <code>asq:where</code> and with <code>;</code> it is also the subject of the included triples.</p>
    <p>The effect is triply pleasing, it's readable, our intentions are clear and all our triples are intact. </p>
    <p>We can add more patterns to refine our selection, so let's constraint by <code>asq:Query</code> too.
        Since our query is one of those, we are guaranteed at least one result:
        </p>
    <pre>
	: asq:where [
		asq:this	:this;
		asq:has		rdf:type;
		asq:that	asq:Query;
	].</pre>

    <p> In some cases, we'll want optional patterns. These are especially helpful when used as solution
        variables to return the object. So, we can ask for the human-readable <code>rdfs:label</code>, if it exists:
    </p>

    <pre>
	: asq:optional [
		asq:this	:this;
		asq:has		rdfs:label;
		asq:that	:label;
	];</pre>

    <p>And here is the expected SPARQL result:</p>
    <pre>
# @namespaces
SELECT DISTINCT ?this ?label
WHERE {
	?this a asq:Query .
	?this a eg:Example .
	OPTIONAL {
		?this rdfs:label ?label .
	}
}
    </pre>
    <p>We can keep going, nesting <code>asq:where</code> and <code>asq:optional</code> clauses.</p>
