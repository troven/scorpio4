    <h2>Source Of Truth</h2>
    <p>A  Source Of Truth (SoT) refers to the practice of structuring data and meta-data so that every element is known by a single authoritative identity, stored in a single definitive location.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> implements a number of tools and strategies to assist with the creation, maintenance and exploitation of an executable source of truth (ESoT)</p>

    <p>Any links or uses of an information element (possibly in a SQL schema, federated or exotic data stores) are by reference only.</p>
    <p>Thus, when any such ESoT element is modified, the update propagates to the dependent systems throughout enterprise. </p>

    <h4>Creating an ESoT</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Import definitions into a semantic store.</li>
        <li>Collect the desired data.</li>
        <li>link data elements together and to their definitions.</li>
        <li>Measure and analyze the data against known standards and benchmarks.</li>
        <li>Derive inter-dependent use cases such as physical schemas, business rules and user interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Master Data Management</h2>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> supports multiple models per business entity.
        A person is not one-dimensional. We are parents, friends, colleagues. With each party, we have different motivations and requirements.</p>
    <p>Each element within the ESoT can be linked to any other, furthermore rich meta-data about the relationship can be captured too.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> employs an RDF/SPARQL repository to store data and meta-data about the enterprise, it's infrastructure and the integration between data, people and processes.
    Your data is not locked into a proprietary format, nor does Scorpio<sup>4</sup> mandate a particular programming style or choice of language.</p>
    <p>We think in terms of aligning information entities to a model of engagement defined by the business.
        We encourage flexibility, different situations call for different approaches. Scorpio<sup>4</sup> captures and then lets you exploit the relationships between the data to rapidly deploy robust, scalable and reliable systems.</p>
    <p>Whether you are building a rich end user experience or system-to-system integration, Scorpio<sup>4</sup> is tooled up and ready to roll.</p>

    <h2>Systems Integration</h2>
    <p>A common approach to working with disparate systems is to employ a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that employs an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).</p>
    <p>A SOA/ESB allows services to interact and inter-operate without the traditional complexity, or strong coupling. </p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> supports industry standard integration patterns (EIP) with technologies including REST, SOAP, MQ, XMPP and dozens more.</p>
    <h2>Knowledge Warehouse</h2>
    <p>A Knowledge Warehouse stores data and meta-data that has, or can be, reshaped and re-purposed to meet different business requirements.</p>
    <p>A Knowledge Warehouse is fed from multiple systems, so it is not an ESoT but rather each data element refers to the ESoT.</p>
    <p>The Knowledge Warehouse stores meta-data about your data environment. It can replicate data too making the repository a richly, query-friendly, self-describing storage engine.</p>
    <p>When we link knowledge with actions, we call that Wisdom Management. Scorpio<sup>4</sup> finally enables us to talk in terms of an Enterprise Wisdom Warehouse.</p>
