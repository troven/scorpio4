    <h2>Passive Vocabularies</h2>
    <p>We use the word passive simply to contrast the <a href="active.html">Active Vocabularies</a>, they can be incredibly powerful. In many use cases they are more useful than an Active Vocabulary.</p>
    <p>That said, a Passive Vocabulary is simply a plain-ole RDFS vocabulary. These are semantic glue binding disparate data together.</p>
    <p>There are hundreds of RDFS vocabularies that describe hundreds of problem domains, covering most industries, with various levels of maturity.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> supports any and all RDF-based vocabularies, with RDFS inferencing supported by default.</p>
    <p>Scorpio<sup>4</sup> can curate RDFS vocabularies from a variety of sources including SQL databases and Spreadsheets too.</p>
    <p>The re-use of existing ontologies is encouraged by the semantic web community, and Scorpio<sup>4</sup> too.</p>
